# Distracting_KATAS
This is a repo for all the katas that distract me while I'm trying to get work done. 
This is mainly because I like working on puzzles and am working on getting better at:
  1. Algorithms
  2. Data Structures
  3. Mathematical Puzzles
  4. Logic in solving Problems
  5. Matrices and Linear Algebra (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, etc)
  6. Regex (regular expressions) -> need to get better at this
  7. Arithmetic Progression/ sequences in programming -> Design patterns
  8. Dictionaries => key value pairs and matrices
  9. Enums (specifically in Ruby, which I don't really know right now, or wait...in Python!)
  10. Bitwise operations => Indempotency, Monotonicity, etc
  11. Currying in other languages (eg. Javascript)
  12. Datetime in Python (stripping/ parsing using RegEx)
  13. Flattening nested lists using Lambdas

I also have a bad habit of not leaving \n after my code. Need to get better at including that on Github.
I apologize for meaningless commits of \n, but it won't become a habit.

Making a list of concepts learning through katas:
 1. Recursion  with Memoization
 2. Binary Expansion
 3. Polybius squares
 4. Hamming Distances
 5. Swapping two Numbers without Temp: (where swap is function swap([ary]))
 
      ary[0] = ary[0] + ary[1]
      
      ary[1] = ary[0] - ary[1]
      
      ary[0] = ary[0] - ary[1]
      
 6. Pascal's Triangle
 7. Collatz Conjecture (3n + 1)
 8. Isogeny -> Cryptography
 9. Bresenham algorithm
 10. Annulus Theorem -> => Area of Annulus-> (PI * L^2) / 4
 11. Holomorphic Functions
 12. Heron's Formula => Math.sqrt(p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)) where a is length a, b is length b, c is length c and p is perimeter / 2
 13. Monte Carlo Integration
 14. Tetration -> Knuth's Up Arrow Notation vs Conway's Chained arrow notation (1->2->3->4 etc)
