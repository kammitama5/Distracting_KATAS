# Distracting_KATAS
This is a repo for all the katas that distract me while I'm trying to get work done. 
This is mainly because I like working on puzzles and am working on getting better at:
  1. Algorithms
  2. Data Structures
  3. Mathematical Puzzles
  4. Logic in solving Problems
  5. Matrices and Linear Algebra (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, etc)
  6. Regex (regular expressions) -> need to get better at this
  7. Arithmetic Progression/ sequences in programming -> Design patterns

I also have a bad habit of not leaving \n after my code. Need to get better at including that on Github.
I apologize for meaningless commits of \n, but it won't become a habit.

Making a list of concepts learning through katas:
 1. Recursion  with Memoization
